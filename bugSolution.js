The solution involves correctly implementing the `keyExtractor` prop within the `FlatList` component to ensure each item has a unique key.  Additionally, it's crucial to manage data updates efficiently to trigger proper re-renders.  Modifying the data array directly without causing a re-render can lead to this issue.

```javascript
//Correct usage of keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>

// Correct data update to trigger re-render
setMyData([...myData, newItem]);
```

Instead of directly modifying the `myData` array, we create a new array using the spread operator (`...`) and append the `newItem`. This change triggers a re-render in the `FlatList` component, thus preventing the rendering of the same item multiple times.
