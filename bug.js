This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same items, causing performance issues and potentially incorrect rendering. This is often due to incorrect usage of the `keyExtractor` prop or improper data management within the `FlatList` component itself.  For example, if the `keyExtractor` isn't properly set, React Native might not correctly identify which items have changed, leading to unnecessary re-renders. If the data source is being modified in a way that doesn't trigger a re-render of the `FlatList` (such as modifying the array in place), the component won't update correctly leading to the same item being rendered multiple times.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage of keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
